LIST NOTES

- In python you can have 
    - an empty list 
    - a list of strings 
    - a list of numbers 
    - a list of mixed variables
    - Even a list of lists 

Syntax for all lists:
    list_name = []

- 0 indexed (1st item = list[0], 5th item = list[4])

- Add items to the end of a list with the .append method
    - ex: things = ["thing1", "thing2"]
    - things.append("thing3");
    - values in things list = thing1, thing2, thing3

- Delete an item from the list using del list[0] (this would delete first thing in list list)
